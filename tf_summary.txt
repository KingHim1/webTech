On Tuesday, his company blasted a 230-foot rocket into orbit, returned its two side boosters to Earth for a flawlessly synchronized landing, and -- with exquisite nerd flair -- propelled Musk's own Tesla Roadster toward deep space, where it's expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years

Known as the Falcon Heavy, the new projectile has 27 engines generating 5 million pounds of thrust, making it the most powerful rocket ever built by a private company SpaceX is already at work on its next generation, the BFR, which it expects will one day transport people to Mars Satellites are getting smaller and lighter, while improvements in engine technology mean that smaller rockets -- such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 -- can handle bigger payloads government, incongruously, is building its own behemoth, the Space Launch System, at a cost of some $23 billion and counting

Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, told Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: How The Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping Our Future: Our Falcon Heavy will not take a busload of people to Mars

They put this down to its reusable rocket parts - the company is the only rocket builder in the world that safely returns first-stage rocket boosters back to Earth 

The idea was for the Falcon Heavy to propel the car into an orbit around the sun that approximates the orbit of Mars (but without the risk of it actually crashing into Mars)

In December Mr Musk tweeted the car would be playing "Space Oddity" by David Bowie as it took off and the glove box would contain a copy of Douglas Adams' book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Specifically, the BFR is designed to conduct planetary entries on Mars and other planets that are yet to be fully explored, and to accomplish this purpose, it would need to survive heat shields and other harsh atmospheric conditions

Being a spaceship with a crew on board, flights are anticipated to be more challenging, but Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, announced in a press conference that it could be ready for experimental takeoffs as early as 2019

Musk claimed that his team has already gained a better understanding of reusable booster technology, allowing them to not just upgrade existing rockets but also to streamline the BFR for space exploration

"There are a lot of uncertainties around this program, but it is going to be our focus," he said just after the Falcon Heavy was launched last Feb

Stashed inside the midnight-cherry Roadster was a mysterious, small object designed to last for millions (perhaps billions) of years  even in extreme environments like space, or on the distant surfaces of far-flung planetary bodies

Called an Arch (pronounced 'Ark'), this tiny storage device is built for long-term data archiving, holding libraries of information encoded on a small disc of quartz crystal, not much larger than a coin"

Subsequent launches are planned for 2020 and 2030, with the 'Lunar' and 'Mars' Arch libraries intended to send curated backups of human knowledge to the Moon and Mars  with the latter disc hoped to serve as a useful aid for colonists on the Red Planet, helping them to 'seed' a localised internet on Mars

In an open letter he said: I want to reassure the scientists, engineers and astronauts at NASA that I will fully fund the International Space Station, and I will do everything in my power to keep the International Space Station flying as long as the safety engineers tell us it is feasible to do so

We want to utilise the space station as much as we can in the remaining time it has and we want to think about what we do next with our partners, both commercial and internationalDonald Trumps administration could announce in their proposed budget that they intend to cease funding for operations to the ISS by 2025

Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the space subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said: There are reports that the administration's new budget would suggest that federal funding for the ISS would expire in 2025

For all the bluster and hype surrounding Musks projects  much of it coming directly from his own Twitter account  observers of SpaceX will note that lately, the less-glamorous aspects of the business, like running errands to the ISS, have been as smooth as Musks hype has been eye-brow raising

On Saturday afternoon, SpaceX, the company started by Elon Musk in 2002 that has the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars, shared a photo of the capsule The most recent successful twofer came on Saturday morning, when the capsule that had been at the space station for month splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just before 11 a It sent up 4,800 pounds of cargo when it launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on December 15 as part of the science-filled CRS-13 missionTwo times now, SpaceX has sent a Dragon cargo capsule to space and back two times

 Because what should have been a celebration of South Koreas titanic cultural, economic and political achievements is degenerating into an event that will instead normalize the barbarous North Korean regime that wants to destroy the South

Are Republicans really conducting an unparalleled attack on the FBI over the Trump-Russia investigation, as the national news media maintain? Byron York at the Washington Examiner suggests that a more accurate description is that theyre condemning the FBI leaderships handling of two of the most heavily politicized investigations in years  the Trump-Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation Now comes word that Kim Jong-uns sister, who has been sanctioned by the US for human-rights abuses, will attend the opening ceremonies, the first-ever visit to South Korea by a member of the ruling family

Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would "build a tunnel boring machine"

Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region

A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: "The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles

The plans are reported to have been well-received by some members of the council as a way of dealing with the region's traffic congestionElon Musk's Boring Company has presented plans to build a tunnel under Culver City, California for a Hyperloop-like transport system
