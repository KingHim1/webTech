On Tuesday, his company blasted a 230-foot rocket into orbit, returned its two side boosters to Earth for a flawlessly synchronized landing, and -- with exquisite nerd flair -- propelled Musk's own Tesla Roadster toward deep space, where it's expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years By mastering reusable rocketry, SpaceX has substantially reduced the expense of getting stuff into orbit, to the benefit of everything from navigation systems to data transmission Satellites are getting smaller and lighter, while improvements in engine technology mean that smaller rockets -- such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 -- can handle bigger payloads Conceivably, the Falcon Heavy could even transport people to the moon, at a fraction of the expected cost of an SLS launch

Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, told Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: How The Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping Our Future: Our Falcon Heavy will not take a busload of people to Mars

They put this down to its reusable rocket parts - the company is the only rocket builder in the world that safely returns first-stage rocket boosters back to Earth 

The idea was for the Falcon Heavy to propel the car into an orbit around the sun that approximates the orbit of Mars (but without the risk of it actually crashing into Mars) In September 2016, a Falcon 9 rocket spontaneously erupted in flames and caused significant damage to a launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station

Specifically, the BFR is designed to conduct planetary entries on Mars and other planets that are yet to be fully explored, and to accomplish this purpose, it would need to survive heat shields and other harsh atmospheric conditions

Being a spaceship with a crew on board, flights are anticipated to be more challenging, but Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, announced in a press conference that it could be ready for experimental takeoffs as early as 2019

Musk claimed that his team has already gained a better understanding of reusable booster technology, allowing them to not just upgrade existing rockets but also to streamline the BFR for space exploration

As part of Musk's vision to bring the human race to Mars, a report reveals that the BFR has specifications that would put it above all rockets ever created

Subsequent launches are planned for 2020 and 2030, with the 'Lunar' and 'Mars' Arch libraries intended to send curated backups of human knowledge to the Moon and Mars  with the latter disc hoped to serve as a useful aid for colonists on the Red Planet, helping them to 'seed' a localised internet on Mars2 disc currently making its way through space on Musk's Tesla Roadster at a cruising speed of some 12,908 km/h (8,021 mph) has been loaded up with Issac Asimov's Foundation trilogy  a seminal sci-fi classic, similarly concerned with the concept of preserving human knowledge and culture in a vast, unforgiving Universe

Called an Arch (pronounced 'Ark'), this tiny storage device is built for long-term data archiving, holding libraries of information encoded on a small disc of quartz crystal, not much larger than a coin

In an open letter he said: I want to reassure the scientists, engineers and astronauts at NASA that I will fully fund the International Space Station, and I will do everything in my power to keep the International Space Station flying as long as the safety engineers tell us it is feasible to do so

We want to utilise the space station as much as we can in the remaining time it has and we want to think about what we do next with our partners, both commercial and international

Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the space subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said: There are reports that the administration's new budget would suggest that federal funding for the ISS would expire in 2025

NASA has also been working with Richard Bransons Virgin to create commercial flights that would allow people to see Earth from the outer-atmosphere

For all the bluster and hype surrounding Musks projects  much of it coming directly from his own Twitter account  observers of SpaceX will note that lately, the less-glamorous aspects of the business, like running errands to the ISS, have been as smooth as Musks hype has been eye-brow raising

On Saturday afternoon, SpaceX, the company started by Elon Musk in 2002 that has the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars, shared a photo of the capsule The most recent successful twofer came on Saturday morning, when the capsule that had been at the space station for month splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just before 11 a It sent up 4,800 pounds of cargo when it launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on December 15 as part of the science-filled CRS-13 mission

Are Republicans really conducting an unparalleled attack on the FBI over the Trump-Russia investigation, as the national news media maintain? Byron York at the Washington Examiner suggests that a more accurate description is that theyre condemning the FBI leaderships handling of two of the most heavily politicized investigations in years  the Trump-Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation Because what should have been a celebration of South Koreas titanic cultural, economic and political achievements is degenerating into an event that will instead normalize the barbarous North Korean regime that wants to destroy the South Now comes word that Kim Jong-uns sister, who has been sanctioned by the US for human-rights abuses, will attend the opening ceremonies, the first-ever visit to South Korea by a member of the ruling family

Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would "build a tunnel boring machine"

The difference between a Loop and a Hyperloop is that the latter requires a vacuum to be created within the tubes to eliminate air friction while the former does not

When asked for further details on the claims in his tweets, a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials

Ms Balajadia stressed that the company was not looking for public funding and that the cost to passengers would be comparable to, or less than existing forms of public transit in the region
