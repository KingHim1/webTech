On Tuesday, his company blasted a 230-foot rocket into orbit, returned its two side boosters to Earth for a flawlessly synchronized landing, and -- with exquisite nerd flair -- propelled Musk's own Tesla Roadster toward deep space, where it's expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years Satellites are getting smaller and lighter, while improvements in engine technology mean that smaller rockets -- such as SpaceX's Falcon 9 -- can handle bigger payloads A few decades from now, more far-out stuff -- space-based energy production, say -- may no longer be science fiction Competition in the space business -- worth some $323 billion annually -- is driving down costs and stimulating both innovation and demand Once again, SpaceX has tried something unreasonable -- surreal, even -- and once again, it has prevailed

Gwynne Shotwell, president and COO of SpaceX, told Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: How The Billionaire CEO of SpaceX and Tesla is Shaping Our Future: Our Falcon Heavy will not take a busload of people to Mars 

The idea was for the Falcon Heavy to propel the car into an orbit around the sun that approximates the orbit of Mars (but without the risk of it actually crashing into Mars)

In December Mr Musk tweeted the car would be playing "Space Oddity" by David Bowie as it took off and the glove box would contain a copy of Douglas Adams' book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Elon Musk himself said that he'd consider Tuesday's launch a "win" if the Falcon Heavy rocket makes it "far enough away from the pad that it doesn't cause pad damage

Specifically, the BFR is designed to conduct planetary entries on Mars and other planets that are yet to be fully explored, and to accomplish this purpose, it would need to survive heat shields and other harsh atmospheric conditions

Musk claimed that his team has already gained a better understanding of reusable booster technology, allowing them to not just upgrade existing rockets but also to streamline the BFR for space exploration

Being a spaceship with a crew on board, flights are anticipated to be more challenging, but Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, announced in a press conference that it could be ready for experimental takeoffs as early as 2019

As part of Musk's vision to bring the human race to Mars, a report reveals that the BFR has specifications that would put it above all rockets ever created

"By eventually connecting the Arch Libraries, and the Arch storage devices they contain, through a decentralised read-write data sharing network that spans the Solar System, we can begin to grow and share a collective decentralised library of everything humanity learns, on every planet in our Solar System, and even beyond, as we spread," Spivack says"

Subsequent launches are planned for 2020 and 2030, with the 'Lunar' and 'Mars' Arch libraries intended to send curated backups of human knowledge to the Moon and Mars  with the latter disc hoped to serve as a useful aid for colonists on the Red Planet, helping them to 'seed' a localised internet on Mars

Called an Arch (pronounced 'Ark'), this tiny storage device is built for long-term data archiving, holding libraries of information encoded on a small disc of quartz crystal, not much larger than a coin

In an open letter he said: I want to reassure the scientists, engineers and astronauts at NASA that I will fully fund the International Space Station, and I will do everything in my power to keep the International Space Station flying as long as the safety engineers tell us it is feasible to do so

Senator Ted Cruz, who chairs the space subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, said: There are reports that the administration's new budget would suggest that federal funding for the ISS would expire in 2025

We want to utilise the space station as much as we can in the remaining time it has and we want to think about what we do next with our partners, both commercial and international

There have been some reports that rather than end missions to the ISS altogether, the Trump administration is planning to privatise the outer-space scientific base

For all the bluster and hype surrounding Musks projects  much of it coming directly from his own Twitter account  observers of SpaceX will note that lately, the less-glamorous aspects of the business, like running errands to the ISS, have been as smooth as Musks hype has been eye-brow raising

The mission that ended on Saturday with the successful splashdown of the Dragon capsule marked the second time a cargo vessel has been used twice The most recent successful twofer came on Saturday morning, when the capsule that had been at the space station for month splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just before 11 a The first time a SpaceX capsule made two trips to the ISS was in September 2014 and then in June 2017 (on the aforementioned CRS-11 mission)

Are Republicans really conducting an unparalleled attack on the FBI over the Trump-Russia investigation, as the national news media maintain? Byron York at the Washington Examiner suggests that a more accurate description is that theyre condemning the FBI leaderships handling of two of the most heavily politicized investigations in years  the Trump-Russia probe and the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation Because what should have been a celebration of South Koreas titanic cultural, economic and political achievements is degenerating into an event that will instead normalize the barbarous North Korean regime that wants to destroy the South Still, the agency over the years has made some horrendous mistakes, most notably the botched investigation  led by an unapologetic Robert Mueller, in fact  of later-exonerated anthrax suspect Steven Hatfill

A report by the Culver City manager's office stated: "The Boring Company has proposed a privately funded human transportation tunnel that would run underneath the Westside of Los Angeles

Mr Musk, who himself lives in Bel Air, is reported by Bloomberg to have first mooted the idea of a tunnel system back in December 2016, when he tweeted that he was fed up with LA traffic and would "build a tunnel boring machine"

However, concerns were expressed by council member Meghan Sahli-Wells about a private company creating a system that may compete with existing public transport agencies in Los Angeles

When asked for further details on the claims in his tweets, a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC: "The Boring Company has had a number of promising conversations with local, state and federal government officials
